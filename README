This is a simple to use 4 polyphonic wavetable synthesizer library for Arduino to serve as a hardware implementation of the PICO-8 PSG.

Specs:

20KHz sample rate using approx 45 % of the available CPU time.
Output audio as PWM on pin 11, pin 3 or ad differential signal on both.
Has 8 built in waveforms SINE, RAMP, SAW, SQUARE (25 %), SQUARE (50%), "ORGAN" and NOISE.
Has 4 built in envelopes.
Each of the 4 voices has parameters for Waveform, Pitch (FREQ based on Octave offset and note), Envelope, Duration and modulation/effects.
Timing functions are available for sample rate sync and end-of-envelope detection.
